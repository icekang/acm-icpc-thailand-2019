    <p>Adapted for the local site, these rules conform to the official ICPC Regional Rules. (<a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/rules" target="_blank">http://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/rules</a>) and ACM-ICPC 2016 Asia Official Regional Rules (<a href="http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_b946da100102wyh6.html" target="_blank">http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_b946da100102wyh6.html</a>)</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class = "display-2">Mission</h2>
    <p>The ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) provides college students with opportunities to interact with students from other universities and to sharpen and demonstrate their problem-solving, programming, and teamwork skills. The contest provides a platform for ACM, industry, and academia to encourage and focus public attention on the next generation of computing professionals as they pursue excellence.</p>
    <p>The ACM-ICPC Asia Regional Contests invite Asian students to meet, to establish friendships, and to promote fair competition in programming and in application use of algorithms and theory.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class = "display-2">Team Composition</h2>
    <p>A representative of the sponsoring institution of higher education, typically a faculty member, must serve as or designate the team coach. The coach certifies the eligibility of contestants and serves as the official point-of-contact with the team prior to and during contest activities. A team may only have one coach and the coach cannot also be a contestant.</p>
    <p>The coach must fully register teams in the ICPC Registration System within the time set by the regional rules which, for all Regional Contests, is no later than October 23. A team is not eligible to compete in the regional contest until the regional contest director has accepted the team in the web registration system. Teams failing to comply with any of these requirements will be ruled ineligible to compete.</p>
    <p>Each team consists of three contestants who are eligible to compete in the ICPC World Finals as described under Advancing to the World Finals in the ICPC Regional Rules. The team's contestants must satisfy the following eligibility rules.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class = "headline">Basic Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A student must be willing and able to compete in the World Finals. In particular, a student who is attending the team’s institution on a visa must have permission to travel to the return destination after the World Finals.</li>
        <li>A student must be enrolled in a degree program at the team’s institution with at least a half-time load. This rule is not to be construed as disqualifying co-op students, exchange students, students serving internships, or extramural students.</li>
        <li>A student may compete for only one institution during a contest year.</li>
        <li>A student who has competed in two World Finals is NOT eligible to compete.</li>
        <li>A student who has competed in Regional Contests for five years is NOT eligible to compete.</li>
        <li>A student may compete in at most two Asia Site Contests, home or not-home administrative sub-region.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3 class = "headline">Period of Eligibility</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A student who meets the Basic Requirements and FIRST began post-secondary studies in 2012 or later is eligible to compete.</li>
        <li>A student who meets the Basic Requirements and was born in 1993 or later is eligible to compete.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 class = "display-2">Conduct of the contest</h2>
    <br>
    <h3 class = "headline">Pre-Contest</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>A calculator and any electronic devices or storages (e.g. mobile phone, CD, DVD, USB flash drive, MP3 player, iPod, iPad, electronic dictionary, etc) are NOT permitted. However, each contestant is allowed to bring one paper dictionary and some personal and stationery items (pen, pencil, ruler, dice, etc) into a contest room. Blank papers will be provided at each workstation.</li>
        <li>A team can bring up to 3 identical copies of Team Reference Document which is defined as follows.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Team Reference Document</b> consists of letter-size or A4-size papers containing notes and/or printed pages (single-sided or double-sided). The total number of pages of the document must not exceed 25 pages. <i style="text-decoration: underline;">All pages must be numbered and the team name and university must appear in the header of every page.</i> Documents must be bought in a folder or stapled together.</li>
                <li>The copies of <b>Team Reference Document and other permitted items</b> will be reviewed by an inspector and <b>left at team’s workstation</b> on the first day (practice session) to be used in the contest session on the next day.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>All teams will use the same equipment and software environment as provided by the organizer. No substitution of keyboards or other hardware will be allowed for the competition. The provided keyboard has a standard QWERTY keyboard layout. We suggest that the contestants acquire a similar keyboard for practice.</li>
        <li>All contestants must wear the contestant T-Shirt and the ID badge (provided on-site) throughout the contest. Only 3 contestants per team are allowed to get into the contest room.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3 class = "headline">In-Contest</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>At least 10 problems will be posed. So far as possible, problems avoid dependence on detailed knowledge of a particular applications area or particular contest language. Of these problems at least two will be solvable by a second-year computer science student and the rest will determine the winner.</li>
        <li>Solutions to contest problems submitted for judging are called runs. Each run is judged as accepted (Yes) or rejected (No) by a judge, and the team is notified of the results within a few minutes after the reception of the run.</li>
        <li>A team should stay logged-in to the PC2 system throughout the contest time with their own account. Logging-in as another team is considered as a cheat.</li>
        <li>Teams should inform the volunteers if they do not get a reply from the judges within 15 minutes after submission. Volunteers will report that to the judges. Teams should also notify the volunteers immediately if any problem concerning PC2 system (e.g. disconnection, forgotten password, program freezing) occurs. Complaints regarding these topics made after the contest is finished may not be considered.</li>
        <li>Notification of rejected or accepted runs to the contestant teams will not be suspended for the last one hour of the contest time but to keep the final result secret the displayed scoreboard will not be updated for last 1 hour.</li>
        <li>A contestant may submit a clarification request to judges. If the judges agree that an ambiguity error exists, a clarification will be issued to all contestants. A trivial request may not be responded.</li>
        <li>Contestants are not to converse with anyone except members of their team and personnel designated by the organizing committee. Systems support staff may advise contestants on system-related problems such as explaining system error messages.</li>
        <li>A team may be disqualified by the Contest Committee for any cheat or attempt of cheating. A team may also be disqualified for any activity that jeopardizes the contest such as dislodging extension cords, unauthorized modification of contest materials, or distracting behavior.</li>
        <li>While the contest is scheduled for a particular time length (5 hours), the judges have the authority to alter the length of the contest in the event of unforeseen difficulties. Should the contest duration be altered, every attempt will be made to notify contestants in a timely and uniform manner.</li>
        <li>With the help of volunteers, the contestants can have a printout of their program listings for debugging purposes. Each team has printing quota of 30 pages.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3 class = "headline">Post-Contest</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Any complaints about the contest must be made to the Contest Committee and Judges within 30 minutes after the contest. After the result has been announced, further complaints must be made according to the Regional Rules (<a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/rules" target="_blank">http://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/rules</a>)</li>
        <li>In consultation with the judges, the Contest Director determines the winners of the contest. The contest director and judges are empowered to adjust for or adjudicate unforeseen events and conditions. Their decisions are final.</li>
        <li>The official contest result and ranking will be announced after the contest in the closing ceremony.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h2 class = "display-2">Scoring and Ranking</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>A problem is solved when it is accepted by the judges. The judges are solely responsible for accepting or rejecting submitted runs.</li>
        <li>The total time of a team is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submittal of the accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes for every rejected run for that problem regardless of submittal time. There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved.</li>
        <li>Teams are ranked according to the most problems solved. For the purposes of awards, or in determining qualifier(s) for the World Finals, teams who solve the same number of problems are ranked by least total time. In the case of equal total time, the less time of the latest problem solved of each team (not including penalty time for that problem) will determine the higher ranked team. If still equal, the time of next-latest problem(s) will be considered.</li>
        <li>During the contest the live scoreboard (containing the number of problems solved of each team and the current ranking) will be shown to the people outside the contest rooms. The contestants and coaches can also have an access to the live scoreboard during the contest. However, the scoreboard will be frozen at about 1 hour before the end of the contest in order to keep the final results secret.</li>
        <li>Each submission, called <i>run</i> will get one of these responses from the judges:
            <ul>
                <li>Yes – Accepted. <br>
                The program produced the correct output within running time limit without any error. This program is accepted by the judges and the problem is considered as solved.</li>
                <li>No – Wrong Answer. <br>
                The program did not produce the correct output.</li>
                <li>No – Runtime Error. <br>
                The program crashed (runtime error) when processing the secret test data.</li>
                <li>No – Time Limit Exceeded. <br>
                The program took more than the time limit to produce output and terminate correctly.</li>
                <li>No – Compilation Error. <br>
                The submitted source code cannot be compiled.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All four <i>No</i> responses are considered rejection and will increase your time by 20 minutes if you solve the problem.</p>
            <p>There may be multiple test cases for some problems. For such problems, the test cases will be judged sequentially. The runs is accepted if it is accepted by all test cases. The first rejection will be the run result, regardless of the result of other test cases. For example, Problem A has 4 test cases. Your submission got Wrong Answer on 2nd test case, and Runtime Error on 3rd test case. In this case, the judge response will be Wrong Answer.</p>
        </li>
